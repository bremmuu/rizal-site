                     <h2>Life as a Teacher</h2>
                    <p>Jose Rizal's life as a teacher was marked by his dedication to education and reform. After returning from Europe in 1887, he established a school in Manila 
                        called the La Liga Filipina. Rizal believed in the power of education to uplift his fellow Filipinos and promote social change. His teaching emphasized 
                        critical thinking, patriotism, and love for the country's culture and history. Rizal's methods focused on inspiring his students to question the status quo 
                        and strive for a better future. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        facing challenges from Spanish authorities who viewed him as a threat, 
                        Rizal's impact as a teacher was profound, influencing many young minds who later became leaders in 
                        the Philippine revolution against Spanish colonial rule.
