                     <h2>Life as a Painter</h2>
                    <p>  Jose Rizal's life as a painter and artist during the late 19th century was marked by his innate talent and passion for visual expression. 
                         He pursued artistic endeavors alongside his academic and political activities, reflecting a multifaceted personality.

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <a class="image-link">
                            <img src="images/saturnina.jpg">
                            <div class="overlay">Saturnina's portrait, sister of Rizal</div>
                        </a>  

                    <p>
                         A symbolic painting of his, titled "A Mother's Revenge", depicts a mother dog fighting
                         a crocodile in order to save her puppy. This conveyed the Filipino struggle against Spanish
                         oppression, which was quite frankly a powerful message during Rizal's generation. Make no
                         mistake, his artistry is not limited to traditional forms for he also excelled in crafting and design.
                         He had a keen eye for detail, making him well rounded in the field of architectural designs. One
                         example was when he designed a water system for the town of Dapitan during his exile in the
                         same place, which was a truly respectable way of practical application of his artistic skills
                         considering that he did it for the betterment of his community.
                    </p> 
                
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <a class="image-link">
                            <img src="images/mother.jpg">
                            <div class="overlay">Portrait of Leonor by Rizal</div>
                        </a>

                    <p> 
                         It is particularly intriguing that Rizal was able to mitigate his artistic skills for both personal
                         expression and nationalistic ideals. Much like his literary skills, his artistry became an important
                         tool for communicating and expressing his vision for a free and enlightened Philippines.
                         Ultimately, his role as an artist tells us the importance of being a well-rounded individual. He
                         blended art with advocacy to give way for societal change and reforms. This will forever inspire
                         Filipinos to use their passion and talents to contribute to the welfare of society.

                        <a class="image-link">
                            <img src="images/leonor2.jpg">
                            <div class="overlay">Portrait of Leonor by Rizal</div>
                        </a>
                    <p>  
                         In conclusion, Rizal's legacy as an artist is significantly on par with his legacy as a writer and a
                         revolutionary. For our former Hispanic colonizer, his artistry reflects his radical and lunatic ideas,
                         but for us Filipinos, it reflects his genius mind and resilient heart, committed to fight and bleed
                         for his country's cause.
