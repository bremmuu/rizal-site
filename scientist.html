                     <h2>Life as a Scientist</h2>
                    <p>Jose Rizal explored various scientific interests during the late 19th century. He had a strong passion for botany, 
                        studying plants extensively both in the Philippines and abroad. His studies included documenting indigenous knowledge 
                        about plants and natural resources, showing his dedication to preserving local traditions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rizal also trained as an eye surgeon in Europe, where he gained recognition for his skills in ophthalmology. 
                        His fascination with anthropology and languages further deepened his understanding of different cultures. 
                    </p>

                        </a>

                    <p>
                        Rizal believed in the importance of scientific education for national progress, advocating for reforms that 
                        promoted critical thinking and scientific inquiry in the Philippines. Ultimately, he made a sculpture that resembles pioneering humanity through science.

                    <p>   
                        His scientific pursuits reflected not only personal interests but also his commitment to social reform and nationalism, leaving a lasting legacy that integrated scientific 
                        curiosity with broader societal goals.'
