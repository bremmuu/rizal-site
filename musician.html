                     <h2>Life as a Musician</h2>
                    <p>Jose Rizal, aside from his literary achievements, also showed talent in music. 
                    He learned to play various instruments like the piano, flute, guitar, violin during 
                    his childhood in Calamba, Laguna, under the guidance of his mother, Teodora Alonso. Rizal composed Kundiman ni Rizal,
                     Alin Mang Lahi, Leonor, and Pastores A Belen. </p>

                            <img src="images/leonor.jpg">
                            <div class="overlay">Music Sheet of Leonor</div>
                        </a>
                    <p>During his stay in Madrid, Rizal frequented the Teatro Real (Royal Theatre) and other concert venues, where he 
                    immersed himself in the works of renowned composers like Verdi, Wagner, and Beethoven. 

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <a class="image-link">
                            <img src="images/teatro.jpg">
                            <div class="overlay">Teatro Real, Madrid</div>
                        </a>

                    <p>He also attended performances by Spanish and Italian opera singers, further broadening his musical horizons. Rizal's exposure to European music not only influenced his compositions but also shaped his appreciation for the arts as a powerful medium for cultural expression and social commentary. His interactions with fellow Filipino expatriates in Europe, who shared his love for music, provided a supportive community and opportunities for collaborative musical endeavors. Rizal's experiences in Europe underscored his commitment to cultural exchange and his efforts to promote Filipino identity through music amidst the backdrop of the Philippine struggle for independence.</p>
